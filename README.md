# Shortest-Path-Finding-Algorithm-visualization
In this project, the famous Astar algorithm has been implemented on python. The program creates a grid on which the user can set a start node and end node and place several obstacles in the way.Once executed, the program shows the shortest path between these 2 nodes .
